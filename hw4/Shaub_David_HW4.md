All problems were completed, including problem 5.

## Problem 1

The python file `p1_avrowriter.py`:
```
"""Load the text logfiles and save them in a single avro file"""
import avro.schema
from avro.datafile import DataFileWriter
from avro.io import DatumWriter

# Read the schema file
schema = avro.schema.parse(open('input_logs.avsc', 'rb').read())

# Define the files to process
input_files = ['logs_{}.txt'.format(i) for i in range(4)]
with DataFileWriter(open('logs.avro', 'wb'), DatumWriter(), schema) as writer:
    # Process each input file
    for input_file in input_files:
        # Open each input file
        with open(input_file, 'r') as current_file:
            # Process each line in each input file
            for line in current_file:
                current_line = line.strip().split('\t')
                # Only parse and write if there is correct input
                if len(current_line) == 3:
                    timestamp, url, user = current_line
                    # Write to avro
                    writer.append({'timestamp': timestamp, 'url': url, 'user': user})
```

The avro schema was easy to create since all fields are `string` values. The only field that *could* have another type would be the timestamp field as a date/time object, but since avro does not have a primitive date/time object, we use a string for this too:
```
{"namespace": "logs.avro",
 "type": "record",
 "name": "visits",
 "fields": [
     {"name": "timestamp", "type": "string"},
     {"name": "url",  "type": "string"},
     {"name": "user", "type": "string"}
 ]
}
```
We launch the conversion process:
```
$ python p1_avrowriter.py
```
And examine the results in `logs.avro` that are partially human-readable:
```
$ head -c 2000 logs.avro 
Objavro.schema?{"type": "record", "namespace": "logs.avro", "name": "visits", "fields": [{"type": "string", "name": "timestamp"}, {"type": "string", "name": "url"}, {"type": "string", "name": "user"}]}avro.codenullg?W?LÜ•?N

## Problem 2

Only very minor changes were required from our previous streaming MR jobs that used input data in text format. The reducers do not need to change at all since they receive identical output data from the mapper and are not inpacted by the input data format on disk. The mappers can structurally remain the same, but we make a few tiny modifications to handle the avro input: instead of manually splitting the input line on the table character and producing an array, we load the JSON line into a python dict and can then easily access the fields we are interested in.


## Problem 3

## Problem 4

The parquet format is efficient for job that do not require acces to all columns since only data from the columns that are required are read. In our problem here, we do not need any data from the user columns, so this is not read. In general this format would be very efficient for scenarios where are data has a large number of columns but we only need to read a few columns since we we only need to read a tiny fractional amount of the data compared to a row-store format.

## Problem 5

Our avro schema now includes a field for `uuid`. This is of type string and our program will generate this data by MD5 hashing the input line so that if we have two identical inputs we will generate a collision.
